# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities **privately**. Do not open a public
issue, pull request, or discussion for a suspected security problem.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository:
https://github.com/XukuLLC/attesto_phoenix/security/advisories/new

(From the repository's **Security** tab, choose **Report a vulnerability**.)

Reports are acknowledged as quickly as possible, and you will be kept informed
while the issue is investigated and a fix is prepared. Please allow a
reasonable period for a fix to ship before any public disclosure.

For coordinated disclosure and CVE assignment across the Erlang/Elixir
ecosystem, you may also contact the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation's CNA at
cna@erlef.org.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release on
[Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/attesto_phoenix). Please upgrade to the latest version before
reporting an issue.

## Authorization-Code Private Context

The built-in Ecto authorization-code store suppresses application SQL logging
and Ecto query telemetry for operations that insert or return trusted
authorization-code `private_context`. Other lifecycle operations retain normal
observability because they neither bind nor return that field. Custom stores
must provide equivalent protections. This does not disable or configure logging
inside the database server; database statement and parameter logging remain the
host operator's responsibility.
