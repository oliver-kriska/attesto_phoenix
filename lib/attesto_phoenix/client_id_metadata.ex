defmodule AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  Integration façade for Client ID Metadata Documents - CIMD
  (`draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-01`, IETF OAuth WG).

  CIMD lets a client identify itself with no prior registration by using an
  HTTPS URL as its `client_id`; the authorization server dereferences that URL
  to a JSON client metadata document and uses it as the client. The pure URL/
  document validation lives in `Attesto.ClientIdMetadata`, the SSRF-guarded
  fetch in `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Fetcher`, the cache in
  `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Cache`, and the orchestration in
  `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Resolver`. This module is the thin seam the
  HTTP endpoints (the authorization endpoint and the token / PAR client
  authentication path) call to decide whether a presented `client_id` is a CIMD
  URL and, when it is, to resolve it into a client.

  ## When CIMD applies

  A presented `client_id` is resolved through CIMD only when both hold
  (`cimd_client_id?/2`):

    * the feature is enabled for the deployment
      (`AttestoPhoenix.Config.client_id_metadata_enabled?/1`), and
    * the `client_id` is a well-formed CIMD URL
      (`Attesto.ClientIdMetadata.client_id_url?/1`).

  An opaque (non-URL) `client_id`, or any `client_id` when the feature is off,
  is left to the host's `:load_client` registry exactly as before - CIMD never
  changes the resolution of a registered client.

  ## The resolved client

  `resolve/2` returns the normalized, string-keyed metadata map
  `Attesto.ClientIdMetadata.validate_document/2` produced (carrying at least
  `client_id` and `redirect_uris`). It is *not* the host's opaque client value,
  so the host's `:client_id` / `:client_redirect_uris` / `:client_jwks`
  callbacks do not apply to it; the accessors here
  (`client_id/1`, `redirect_uris/1`, `jwks/1`) read the document directly, and
  the calling endpoint uses them in place of the host callbacks for a CIMD
  client. A resolved CIMD client authenticates only as a public client
  (`none` + PKCE) or with `private_key_jwt`; the no-symmetric-secret rule the
  document validation enforces guarantees `client_secret_*` can never apply.

  ## redirect_uri policy (RFC 9700 + draft §2)

  RFC 9700 requires the request `redirect_uri` to exact-match one of the
  document's `redirect_uris`; the calling endpoint performs that match through
  the same `Attesto.AuthorizationRequest` path it uses for a registered client,
  feeding it `redirect_uris/1` as the registered set. The draft additionally
  permits requiring the `redirect_uri` to be same-origin (scheme + host + port)
  with the `client_id` URL; `same_origin_redirect_uri?/2` is that check, applied
  by the authorization endpoint when `:require_same_origin_redirect_uri` is set
  (the default).

  `draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-01` §7 carries the RFC 7591 §2

  string. A document that omits it declares no scopes, so this returns `[]` — an
  empty *declared* set, never a missing key. A CIMD client therefore has no
  registered scope cap of its own; what an empty declared set grants is host
  policy (typically the scopes the resource owner consents to).

  This is the value `AttestoPhoenix.AuthorizationServer.Token` exposes to a host
  `:authorize_scope` policy as `client.scopes`, so a callback written for a
  registered client's scope list reads a CIMD client as an empty set instead of
