defmodule AttestoPhoenix.Config do
  @moduledoc """
  Configuration for the `attesto_phoenix` authorization-server layer.

  This is the single source of truth consumed by every controller and plug in
  the library. It reads the host's configuration (from a host-chosen
  `otp_app`/config key), validates the required keys, applies neutral defaults,
  and derives the `Attesto.Config` the protocol layer needs.

  Build one with `new/1` (from a keyword list or map) or `from_otp_app/2` (to
  read `Application.get_env/2`). Validation raises `ArgumentError` on a missing
  required key so misconfiguration fails fast at boot.

  ## Keys

  ### Required

    * `:issuer` - absolute HTTPS issuer URL (string, with no query or fragment)
      used as the JWT `iss`, the discovery issuer, and the base for endpoint
      URLs. The bundled router's root well-known routes require an origin-only
      issuer; a path-bearing issuer requires standards-derived well-known
      routes mounted by the host. Derived endpoint URLs are resolved against
      the issuer *origin*: an issuer path is not prepended to the resolved
      endpoint paths, so a path-bearing issuer must also set
      `:oauth_path_prefix` (or the per-endpoint path overrides) to advertise
      its endpoints under that path.
    * `:keystore` - module implementing `Attesto.Keystore` providing the
      signing key and the verification keys published via JWKS. Use a static
      keystore or a host KMS/HSM/Vault-backed implementation; per-key `alg`
      metadata is supported by the core keystore behaviour.
    * `:vc_keystore` - the keystore used to sign issued Verifiable Credentials;
      defaults to `:keystore`. Configure a separate EC/ES256 keystore here to
      issue ES256-signed credentials (e.g. for HAIP) while ID tokens keep their
      own signing key.
    * `:verifier_encryption_keystore` - a dedicated EC P-256 keystore used only
      to advertise and decrypt encrypted OID4VP `direct_post.jwt` responses.
      It has no fallback to `:keystore`; encrypted-response request creation
      fails closed when this setting is absent or is not a usable private P-256
      key.
    * `:repo` - `Ecto.Repo` module used by the Ecto-backed code, refresh,
      nonce, and replay stores.
    * `:load_client` - `(client_id -> {:ok, client} | {:error, :not_found} |
      {:error, :revoked})`. Resolves an OAuth client. The host owns the client
      registry and revocation policy.
    * `:verify_client_secret` - `(client, presented_secret -> boolean)`.
      Constant-time client-secret verification (e.g. via
      `Attesto.SecureCompare`). The host owns secret hashing.
    * `:load_principal` - `(subject_id -> {:ok, principal} | {:error,
      :not_found})`. Resolves the subject/principal during protected-resource
      authentication.

  ### Optional callbacks

    * `:authorize_scope` - `(client, requested_scope -> {:ok, granted_scope} |
      {:error, :invalid_scope})`. Validates/narrows requested scope using
      `Attesto.Scope` algebra. Defaults to "subset of `:scopes_supported`".
    * `:on_event` - `(%AttestoPhoenix.Event{} -> any)`. Audit/telemetry hook.
      No-op by default; the library never stores events itself.
    * `:send_error` - `(conn, status, body_map -> conn)`. Optional transport
      hook used by `AttestoPhoenix.OAuthError` to serialize OAuth/OIDC errors
      into the host's API envelope while preserving the RFC status, challenge,
      and cache-control semantics.
    * `:no_store` - `(conn -> conn)`. Optional transport hook used by
      `AttestoPhoenix.OAuthError` to apply no-store headers.
    * `:www_authenticate` - `(conn, challenge_string -> conn)`. Optional
      transport hook used by `AttestoPhoenix.OAuthError` to write the
      `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header.
    * `:resource_metadata` - absolute HTTPS URL (with no fragment) of this
      resource's protected-resource metadata document (RFC 9728). When set,
      `AttestoPhoenix.Plug.Authenticate` advertises it as a `resource_metadata`
      auth-param on every
      `WWW-Authenticate` challenge it renders (RFC 9728 §5.1), so a client that
      is refused with 401 can discover which authorization server issues tokens
      for this resource. Omitted from the challenge when unset.
    * `:resource_metadata_resolver` - `(conn -> absolute_url | nil)`. Optional
      request-aware override for `:resource_metadata`. When configured, its
      result selects the RFC 9728 metadata URI for that protected-resource
      request; returning `nil` deliberately omits the auth-param. This lets one
      origin serve multiple resource identifiers without pointing every
      challenge at one global document. An invalid callback result is omitted
      rather than advertised. The resolver is consulted once per
      protected-resource request - including requests that authenticate
      successfully, because the selected URI must be in place before
      verification renders any challenge - so it should be fast and total.
      Exceptions raised by the resolver are not rescued and abort the request,
      successful ones included. When unset, the static `:resource_metadata`
      value retains its existing behavior. The callback is trusted configuration:
      return pinned or allowlisted metadata URLs and do not derive their
      authority from request Host, forwarded, query, or header values.
    * `:basic_realm` - realm string for token-endpoint Basic auth challenges.
      Default `"OAuth"`.
    * `:htu` - `(conn -> canonical_url_string)`. Overrides how the DPoP `htu`
      is computed behind proxies. Defaults to derivation from `:trusted_proxies`.
    * `:cert_der` - `(conn -> der_binary | nil)`. Deprecated compatibility alias
      for terminator-provided certificate extraction. It is invoked only when
      the adapter-reported immediate socket peer matches `:trusted_proxies`.
      Migrate header readers to `:forwarded_cert_der`. Direct TLS adapters
      expose the authenticated certificate through `Plug.Conn.get_peer_data/1`
      and need no callback.
    * `:forwarded_cert_der` - `(conn -> der_binary | nil)`. Extracts a client
      certificate forwarded by a TLS terminator. Unlike `:cert_der`, this
      callback is invoked only when the immediate peer matches
      `:trusted_proxies`; an untrusted request can never make its certificate
      header authoritative. The terminator MUST remove any client-supplied
      copy of the header and replace it only after a successful client TLS
      handshake; the application listener SHOULD be network-reachable only
      from those trusted terminators.
    * `:client_certificate_chain_validated?` - `(conn, der -> boolean)`.
      Confirms that the TLS terminator validated the presented certificate's
      PKI chain, validity, and applicable revocation policy. Required for
      `tls_client_auth`; the self-signed method does not use PKI validation.
    * `:client_mtls_metadata` -
      `(client -> map | {:ok, map} | nil | {:error, reason})`. Returns the
      client's RFC 8705 registration metadata, including
      `token_endpoint_auth_method` and exactly one PKI subject field for
      `tls_client_auth`. Return `nil` only when the client has no mTLS
      registration; errors and malformed results fail authentication closed.
      For `self_signed_tls_client_auth`, `:client_jwks` supplies the resolved
      JWK Set.
    * `:register_client` - `(metadata -> {:ok, client} | {:error, reason})`.
      Persists a dynamically registered client. Required only when
      `:registration_enabled`.
    * `:unregister_client` - `(client -> :ok | {:ok, client} | {:error, reason})`.
      Deletes a dynamically registered client for registration management
      cleanup (RFC 7592). Optional; when unset, DELETE requests to the
      registration management endpoint fail closed.
    * `:client_registration_access_token_hash` - `(client -> String.t() | nil)`.
      Extracts the stored hash of the registration access token issued with a
      dynamic client (RFC 7592). Optional; when unset, DELETE requests fail
      closed.
    * `:introspection_authorize` - `(caller_client_id, response -> boolean)`.
      Authorizes the authenticated introspection caller against the token being
      introspected (RFC 7662 §4 / RFC 9701 §5). Consulted only for an active
      response; returning anything but `true` (or raising) downgrades the
      response to `%{"active" => false}` so a caller not entitled to the token
      learns nothing about it (FAPI: a regular client querying introspection is
      a leakage risk). `response` is the RFC 7662 member map (carrying `aud`,
      `client_id`, `sub`, `scope`, ...), letting the host match the token's
      audience/scope against the calling protected resource. Optional - when
      unset, every authenticated caller may introspect any token (the
      single-trust-domain default).
    * `:resource_indicators` - RFC 8707 resource policy as
      `[allowed_resources: [...], allowed_resources_for: callback]`. Static
      entries are absolute resource URIs. The optional one-argument callback
      receives the original OAuth client and returns additional identifiers
      that client may target. The same policy governs issuance, introspection,
      and token-exchange subject-token verification.
    * `:native_apps` - RFC 8252 (BCP 212) native-app profile options as
      `[loopback_redirect: true, loopback_include_localhost: false,
      reject_embedded_user_agents: false]`.

      The profile as a whole is off until the host classifies a client with
      `:client_native?`, which defaults to `false`. That callback — not
      anything here — is what keeps an unconfigured deployment byte-identical.

      `:loopback_redirect` is an **opt-out**, defaulting to `true`. RFC 8252
      §7.3 states the port allowance as a MUST, so it follows from a client
      being marked native: a `redirect_uri` of `http://127.0.0.1/...` or
      `http://[::1]/...` matches the registered URI on any port, while scheme,
      host, path, and query still compare exactly. Nothing else is relaxed —
      `https`, private-use schemes, remote hosts, and the hostname `localhost`
      (§8.3 discourages it) all stay exact-match, as does every non-native
      client. Set it `false` to forbid the exception server-wide: an operator
      kill switch, or a deployment certifying against a profile that mandates
      exact redirect-URI matching (the OpenID Connect and FAPI profiles do).
      Such a deployment normally has no native clients to begin with, so the
      usual answer is simply not to mark any.

      `:loopback_include_localhost` is an **opt-in**, defaulting to `false`. It
      widens the §7.3 port allowance to the bare hostname `localhost`, selecting
      `Attesto.RedirectURI`'s `:exact_allow_loopback_port_including_localhost`
      mode wherever `:exact_allow_loopback_port` would have been selected. §8.3
      recommends the IP literal over the name, but its reasons are all about
      what the *client* binds and how the user's device resolves names - a
      server refusing the request changes none of them - and real native
      clients (Claude Code's published metadata document among them) register a
      portless `http://localhost/callback` and bind an ephemeral port, which no
      strict deployment can serve at all. The name stays a distinct host
      identity: `localhost` never cross-matches `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`, and
      everything else about the exception keeps its exact-match discipline (see
      `Attesto.RedirectURI` for the full constraint list). It is subordinate to
      `:loopback_redirect`: when that kill switch is `false`, this option has
      no effect.

      `:reject_embedded_user_agents` enables the RFC 8252 §8.12 recommendation
      that the authorization endpoint refuse requests made from an in-app
      webview, which the host application can use to observe the user's
      credentials. Detection is a `User-Agent` heuristic
      (`AttestoPhoenix.RequestContext.embedded_user_agent?/1`) and therefore
      produces false positives, which is why it is opt-in and applies to every
      client rather than only native ones — the embedding app is not
      necessarily the OAuth client.

      The remaining RFC 8252 obligations (§8.1 PKCE, §8.4 client
      authentication) likewise follow from `:client_native?` alone: they are
      strictly additional restrictions on a client the host has deliberately
      classified as native.
    * `:principal_kinds` - non-empty list of `Attesto.PrincipalKind` values
      or a zero-arity callback returning that list, passed into the core token
      configuration.
    * `:build_principal` - `(client, subject, scope -> map)`. Builds the
      principal map passed to `Attesto.Token.mint/3`. The returned `:sub` MUST
      be namespaced with the matching `Attesto.PrincipalKind` `sub_prefix`:
      `Attesto.Token` rejects an unprefixed subject at mint time
      (`:invalid_sub`). This matters most for the `client_credentials` grant
      (RFC 6749 §4.4), where the principal subject is the OAuth `client_id` -
      and Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591 §3.2.1) issues that id
      *unprefixed* (the host's `:register_client` chooses it; the library
      imposes no namespace). `:build_principal` is the sole seam that applies
      the prefix; the prefix is mint-time defense-in-depth (an issued token's
      `sub` is unambiguous across principal kinds), not a substitute for it.
      The protocol layer injects the authenticated OAuth `client_id` claim
      required by RFC 9068; the callback may omit it or return the same value,
      but a conflicting value fails issuance.
    * `:authorization_grant_id_claim` - optional access-token claim name for a
      stable, opaque identifier of the authorization grant. When configured,
      authorization-code, device-code, and CIBA access tokens—and refreshed
      access tokens descended from them—carry the same identifier; persisted
      refresh-token records use it as their `family_id`. Separate grants remain
      distinct even for the same subject and client. Client credentials,
      OID4VCI pre-authorized code, token exchange, and ID-JAG JWT-bearer grants
      omit it, and token exchange does not inherit the subject token's value.
      This is useful for grant-scoped resource-server sessions and revocation.
      If policy declines refresh-token issuance, the access-token claim still
      identifies the grant, but no persisted refresh family exists to query or
      revoke. The signed identifier is correlation only: it does not prove that
      the grant is active or that persisted authority exists. A resource server
      that requires family-state enforcement must limit the feature to
      refresh-capable grants and check durable state independently.
      It is off by default because it adds a correlation handle to access
      tokens. Use a collision-resistant claim name under a namespace the host
      controls, for example `"https://api.example/claims/oauth_grant_id"`.
      Do not configure `"sid"`: OIDC defines that as the End-User's OP browser
      session, which is a different lifecycle.
    * `:authorization_grant_id_claim_aliases` - former or alternate grant-ID
      claim names that remain protocol-owned while older access tokens are
      valid. Aliases must be unique and distinct from the active claim. They are
      never minted; the token endpoint removes them from host principal claims
      and from tokens produced by token exchange. Keep a retired name here
      through the maximum lifetime of tokens that used it. This list may remain
      configured when `:authorization_grant_id_claim` is `nil`, allowing active
      issuance to stop without letting token exchange re-sign a retired
      identifier.
    * `:build_userinfo_claims` - `(subject, granted_scopes, requested_claims ->
      claims_map)`. Produces the claim values the UserInfo endpoint
      (OpenID Connect Core §5.3) returns for the authenticated subject. The
      host owns the claim source (its user store); the library owns only the
      scope-to-claim shaping (OpenID Connect Core §5.4) and the guarantee that
      `sub` is present (OpenID Connect Core §5.3.2). `granted_scopes` is the
      list of scopes on the access token; `requested_claims` is the per-claim
      request map from the OpenID Connect `claims` parameter (`%{}` when none).
      Required only when the UserInfo endpoint is mounted.
    * `:build_credential` - `(subject, credential_configuration_id,
      holder_jwk -> {:ok, credential} | {:error, reason})`. Produces the
      format-specific claim material and optional validity window for the
      OID4VCI Credential endpoint. For SD-JWT VC and JWT VC, the library binds
      `holder_jwk` as `cnf`; for mdoc, it binds the key as the MSO device key.
      The library signs the resulting credential. Required when credential
      issuance is mounted.
    * `:build_deferred_credential` - `(subject, transaction_id -> {:ok,
      credential} | {:error, :issuance_pending} | {:error, reason})`.
      Completes a previously deferred credential (OID4VCI §9) for the
      Deferred Credential endpoint. The returned credential type and claim
      values are signed into an SD-JWT VC the same way `:build_credential`'s
      are, minus holder-key binding (the endpoint carries no fresh proof).
      `{:error, :issuance_pending}` reports the OID4VCI `issuance_pending`
      error so the wallet retries later; any other error maps to
      `invalid_credential_request`. Required only when the Deferred
      Credential endpoint is used.

      **Security — this callback owns the ownership check.** The library
      authenticates the caller's access token and passes you its verified
      `subject`, but it does not (and cannot) know which subject a
      `transaction_id` belongs to — deferred-issuance state lives in your
      store. You MUST resolve the transaction scoped to `subject` and return an
      error (not the credential) when the `transaction_id` was not issued to
      that subject. Resolving by `transaction_id` alone is an IDOR: any
      authenticated wallet could poll another wallet's `transaction_id` and
      receive that holder's credential. Additionally, mint the `transaction_id`
      with a CSPRNG (e.g. `Attesto.Secret.generate/0`, 256-bit) so it cannot be
      guessed or enumerated.
    * `:credential_configurations_supported` - map of OID4VCI credential
      configuration identifiers to the configuration metadata advertised by
      the Credential Issuer Metadata endpoint. Required when credential
      issuance is mounted.
    * `:federation_authority_hints` - non-empty list of superior OpenID
      Federation entity identifiers to include in this entity's signed Entity
      Configuration. Optional; the claim is omitted when unset.
    * `:federation_entity_metadata` - map of OpenID Federation entity-type
      identifiers to their metadata. Optional; the claim is omitted from the
      signed Entity Configuration when unset.
    * `:status_list_store` - module implementing `Attesto.StatusListStore`,
      the allocated-index storage for IETF Token Status List (RFC-to-be)
      credential-status lists. Required when the host mounts the
      `status_list: true` route; the endpoint answers 404 for a list it
      cannot resolve through this store.
    * `:build_id_token_claims` - `(client, subject, granted_scopes,
      requested_claims -> claims_map)`. Produces the host claims merged into an
      ID Token (OpenID Connect Core §3.1.3.6 / §5.5 `id_token` member). Distinct
      from `:build_userinfo_claims`: it receives the resolved `client`, draws
      from the `claims` parameter's `id_token` member, and MUST NOT carry `sub`
      (the library sets the verified subject; a host-supplied `sub` is rejected
      by `Attesto.IDToken`). Optional - when unset the ID Token carries only the
      protocol claims.
    * `:client_id` - `(client -> String.t())`. Extracts the OAuth client
      identifier from the host's client struct.
    * `:client_jwks` - `(client -> jwks)`. Returns the client's trusted public
      JWK Set for `private_key_jwt` client authentication. Required only for
      clients that authenticate with `private_key_jwt`.
    * `:client_redirect_uris` - `(client -> [String.t()])`. Returns the
      client's registered redirect URIs (RFC 6749 §3.1.2.2). The authorization
      endpoint exact-matches the request `redirect_uri` against this set
      (RFC 6749 §3.1.2.3); a client exposing none rejects every authorization
      request (fail closed).
    * `:authenticate_resource_owner` - `(conn, request, auth_opts ->
      {:authenticated, subject} | {:halt, conn} | {:none} | {:error,
      :login_required | :consent_required | :interaction_required})`.
      Establishes the resource owner for an authorization request (RFC 6749
      §3.1, OIDC Core §3.1.2.3). Returns `{:authenticated, subject}` once a
      resource owner is known (a map carrying at least `:subject`, the OIDC
      `sub`, and optionally `:auth_time`, `:acr`, `:amr`), `{:halt, conn}` to
      take over the connection (e.g. redirect to a host login page that
      re-enters the authorization endpoint), `{:none}` when no subject can be
      established without UI, or an `{:error, _}` classifying why interaction is
      required (OIDC Core §3.1.2.6). `auth_opts` is a map carrying the OIDC Core
      §3.1.2.1 `prompt`/`max_age` directives the host must honour: `:prompt`,
      `:force_reauth` (`prompt=login`), `:interactive` (`false` for
      `prompt=none`, forbidding UI), and `:max_age`. The host owns all login
      UI; the library only invokes this hook. Required only when the
      authorization endpoint is mounted.
    * `:consent` - `(conn, request, subject -> {:consented, subject} |
      {:halt, conn} | {:denied, reason})`. Obtains the resource owner's consent
      for an authorization request (RFC 6749 §4.1.1). Returns
      `{:consented, subject}` to proceed (the returned subject may carry
      consent-derived claims), `{:halt, conn}` to take over the connection (e.g.
      render a consent screen that re-enters the authorization endpoint), or
      `{:denied, reason}` to refuse (reported to the client as `access_denied`,
      RFC 6749 §4.1.2.1). When unset, consent is implicitly granted for the
      authenticated subject.
    * `:client_public?` - `(client -> boolean())`. Returns whether a client
      may authenticate without a secret and rely on PKCE.
    * `:client_native?` - `(client -> boolean())`. Returns whether a client is
      an installed native application (RFC 8252 / BCP 212). Defaults to `false`
      when unset, so a host that does not classify its clients gets no RFC 8252
      behavior. A native client always requires PKCE (§8.1) and, when it is
      also public, may not authenticate at the token endpoint with a secret
      (§8.4). See also `:native_apps`.
    * `:client_requires_mtls?` - `(client -> boolean())`. Returns whether a
      client requires mTLS-bound token issuance.
    * `:client_requires_dpop?` - `(client -> boolean())`. Returns whether a
      client requires DPoP-bound token issuance.
    * `:client_grant_types` - `(client -> [String.t()] | nil)`. Returns the
      grant types registered for this client (RFC 7591 §2). When set, the
      token endpoint rejects a requested grant type not in the returned list.
    * `:issue_refresh_token?` - `(client, granted_scope -> boolean())`.
      Returns whether the authorization-code grant should issue an initial
      refresh token (RFC 6749 §6). When unset, the token controller issues one
      iff the granted scope contains `offline_access` (OIDC Core §11) and a
      `:refresh_store` is configured.
    * `:code_store` - module implementing `Attesto.CodeStore`.
    * `:refresh_store` - module implementing `Attesto.RefreshStore`.
    * `:par_store` - module implementing `AttestoPhoenix.PARStore`. Defaults to
      the single-node `AttestoPhoenix.Store.PAR.ETS`; use
      `AttestoPhoenix.Store.EctoPARStore` for a clustered/load-balanced
      deployment so a `request_uri` resolves on every node (FAPI 2.0 requires
      PAR).
    * `:consent_grant_store` - module implementing
      `AttestoPhoenix.ConsentGrantStore`, the single-use request-bound consent
      primitive (RFC 6749 §4.1.1). The host consent screen mints a grant when
      the resource owner authorizes; the host's `:consent` callback consumes it
      before a code is issued, so one consent click cannot approve a different
      client/redirect/scope/challenge. The library ships the Ecto-backed
      `AttestoPhoenix.Store.EctoConsentGrantStore`; there is no default, because
      the library never renders a consent screen — a host wires this only when
      it adopts the consent primitive. Read it back with
      `consent_grant_store/1`.
    * `:grant_types_supported` - the grant types the server supports. Advertised
      as `grant_types_supported` (RFC 8414 §2), enforced by the token endpoint (a
      `grant_type` outside the set is rejected), and the accepted set for dynamic
      registration. Defaults to every implemented grant; narrow it to disable one
      (e.g. drop token-exchange) everywhere at once. See `grant_types_supported/1`.
    * `:token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` - client authentication methods
      advertised/accepted by dynamic client registration and by the token/PAR
      endpoints when configured. When unset, all package-supported methods are
      accepted.
    * `:trusted_wallet_provider_jwks` - trusted Wallet Provider public keys for
      `attest_jwt_client_auth`, as an RFC 7517 JWK Set, a single public JWK map,
      or a list of public JWK maps. The method is disabled and omitted from
      discovery metadata when this is unset.
    * `:key_attestation_trusted_jwks` - trusted keys for verifying a
      `key_attestation` header carried in a credential proof (OID4VCI key
      attestation), same shapes as `:trusted_wallet_provider_jwks`. When unset,
      a present `key_attestation` header is not inspected.
    * `:require_key_attestation` - when `true`, the credential endpoint rejects a
      proof that carries no `key_attestation` header (HAIP). Only meaningful with
      `:key_attestation_trusted_jwks`; defaults to `false`.

  ### Optional values (with defaults)

    * `:audience` - default access-token audience (string or list).
    * `:client_auth_signing_algs` - the JOSE algorithms accepted for
      `private_key_jwt` client-assertion signatures, and the set advertised as
      `token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported` in discovery. Defaults
      to `Attesto.SigningAlg.fapi_algs/0` (PS256, ES256, legacy EdDSA over
      Ed25519, and explicit Ed25519). A non-FAPI deployment can widen it;
      verification and the advertised metadata stay in lockstep because both
      read this one value.
    * `:client_assertion_audiences` - the `aud` values a `private_key_jwt`
      client assertion may carry (RFC 7523 §3), as a list or a one-arity
      function of the config. Defaults to `[issuer, token_endpoint_url]`.

      Both are accepted by default because the profiles disagree: FAPI 2.0
      Security Profile Final §5.3.2.1 requires the issuer identifier, while
      FAPI-CIBA ID1 audiences a token-endpoint assertion to the token endpoint
      URL. A deployment certifying to only one of them can narrow this to
      `[config.issuer]` and refuse the other.

      Narrowing does not add much: both values identify THIS server, so
      accepting either does not let an assertion minted for a different
      authorization server be replayed here — which is what RFC 7523's audience
      restriction is for. It is a conformance knob, not a security one.
    * `:client_auth_enforce_fapi_alg_policy` - additionally enforce FAPI's RSA
      modulus and Edwards-curve restrictions for `private_key_jwt`. When unset,
      this defaults to `true` if `:client_auth_signing_algs` is omitted and to
      `false` if the host supplies an explicit algorithm list. Set it to `true`
      when narrowing the FAPI allowlist; an enforced list must remain a subset
      of `Attesto.SigningAlg.fapi_algs/0`. Set it to `false` only for an
      explicit non-FAPI policy.
    * `:request_object_policy` - an `Attesto.RequestObject.Policy` controlling
      verification of signed authorization request objects (JAR, RFC 9101).
      Defaults to `%Attesto.RequestObject.Policy{}` (generic OpenID Connect §6.1:
      `nbf`/`exp`/`typ` not required). For FAPI 2.0 Message Signing §5.3.1 set
      `Attesto.RequestObject.Policy.fapi_message_signing()`; the policy is then
      enforced both at the PAR endpoint and at `/authorize`. Supplying an
      explicit `accepted_algs` list selects non-FAPI key compatibility unless
      the policy's `enforce_fapi_alg_policy` field is `true`; the named FAPI
      policy sets that field explicitly, so narrowing its list keeps the key
      gate enabled.
    * `:scopes_supported` - list of supported scope strings (concrete and
      wildcard) advertised in discovery and used as the default scope catalog.
      For an OpenID Provider the reserved `openid` scope (OpenID Connect Core
      §3.1.2.1) is added to the OpenID Provider Metadata automatically by the
      core builder; it need not be listed here.
    * `:bearer_methods_supported` - the RFC 6750 access-token presentation
      methods the resource server accepts, advertised as
      `bearer_methods_supported` in the RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata
      document (`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`). A non-empty list of
      distinct methods, each `"header"` (§2.1) or `"body"` (§2.2) - the methods
      `AttestoPhoenix.Plug.Authenticate` accepts. The §2.3 `"query"` method is
      rejected: the plug never accepts a query-presented token, so advertising it
      would name a method the library cannot honour (and RFC 6750 §2.3 says it
      SHOULD NOT be used). Defaults to `["header"]`; add `"body"` only for a
      resource server that intentionally accepts RFC 6750 §2.2 form-body
      `access_token` credentials and wants to advertise that method.
    * `:authorization_endpoint` - absolute HTTPS authorization endpoint URL to
      advertise in OpenID Provider Metadata (RFC 6749 §3.1 / OpenID Connect
      Discovery §3). `attesto_routes/1` mounts the generic controller; the host
      supplies resource-owner authentication and consent through callbacks. It
      defaults to the URL derived from `:issuer` and `:authorize_path`.
    * `:userinfo_endpoint` - absolute HTTPS UserInfo URL to advertise in OpenID
      Provider Metadata (OpenID Connect Core §5.3), `:derived`, or `nil`.
      `attesto_routes/1` mounts the generic controller by default and the host
      supplies claim values through `:build_userinfo_claims`. A URL is an
      authoritative host declaration and remains advertised even when the host
      replaces the bundled route at the same path. `:derived` resolves through
      `userinfo_endpoint_url/1`; when the macro's local UserInfo route is
      disabled, only that derived value is eligible for suppression at the
      removed route-equivalent path. `nil` omits the member.
    * `:claims_supported` - list of claim names the host's UserInfo endpoint
      and ID Tokens can return (OpenID Connect Discovery §3). Advertised in the
      OpenID Provider Metadata; omitted when unset.
    * `:claims_parameter_supported` - whether the provider accepts the OpenID
      Connect `claims` request parameter (OpenID Connect Discovery §3 /
      OpenID Connect Core §5.5). Default `false`: the authorization endpoint
      does not consume a `claims` parameter unless the host wires it, so the
      provider does not claim support for it. Advertised in the OpenID Provider
      Metadata only when set to `true` (the core builder treats absence as
      `false` per OpenID Connect Discovery §3).
    * `:acr_values_supported` - list of Authentication Context Class Reference
      values the provider can satisfy (OpenID Connect Discovery §3 /
      OpenID Connect Core §2). Advertised only when the host configures a
      non-empty list; omitted otherwise.
    * `:ui_locales_supported` - list of BCP47 (RFC 5646) language tags the
      provider's UI supports (OpenID Connect Discovery §3). Advertised only
      when the host configures a non-empty list; omitted otherwise.
    * `:require_nonce` - require the OpenID Connect `nonce` parameter on
      OpenID Connect Authentication Requests (OpenID Connect Core §3.1.2.1).
      Default `false`. When `true`, the authorization endpoint passes
      `require_nonce: true` to `Attesto.AuthorizationRequest.validate/2` for a
      request whose scope contains `openid`, so a missing `nonce` on an OIDC
      request is rejected with a redirectable `invalid_request` error. A
      non-OpenID OAuth 2.0 request is never affected (RFC 6749 keeps the
      authorization code at SHOULD, never requiring a `nonce`). The host sets
      this per its own OpenID Provider policy.
    * `:require_pushed_authorization_requests` - require front-channel
      authorization requests to use a PAR `request_uri` issued by this server
      (RFC 9126). Default `false`.
    * `:authorization_response_iss` - include the RFC 9207 `iss` authorization
      response parameter on success and error redirects. Default `true`
      (authorization-server mix-up defense, mandated by FAPI 2.0); set `false`
      only for a deployment that must omit it.
    * `:require_https` - enforce HTTPS on incoming endpoint requests. Default
      `true`. This transport gate never relaxes the standards-required HTTPS
      issuer or advertised endpoint validation.
    * `:trusted_proxies` - list of trusted proxy CIDRs/IPs controlling whether
      `X-Forwarded-*` headers are honored. Default `[]` (no forwarded trust).
    * `:access_token_ttl` - access-token lifetime, seconds. Default `900`.
    * `:refresh_token_ttl` - refresh-token lifetime, seconds. Default `1_209_600`.
    * `:refresh_token_rotation_grace_seconds` - idempotency window, in
      seconds, during which a just-rotated refresh token can be retried and
      receive the same successor refresh token instead of being treated as a
      reuse attack. Default `60`; set `0` for strict immediate reuse
      revocation. A non-zero window is important for clients that lose the
      first rotation response and retry the previous token (OAuth 2.0 Security
      BCP §4.13; FAPI 2.0 Security Profile §5.3.2.1).
    * `:authorization_code_ttl` - authorization-code lifetime, seconds. Default `60`.
    * `:dpop_enabled` - enable DPoP sender-constraint support. Default `true`.
    * `:dpop_nonce_required` - require server-issued DPoP nonces. Default `false`.
    * `:mtls_enabled` - enable mTLS (RFC 8705) `cnf` binding. Default `false`.
    * `:mtls_endpoint_aliases` - RFC 8705 §5 endpoint-name-to-HTTPS-URL map for
      a listener that requests client certificates separately from conventional
      endpoints. Omitted by default.
    * `:registration_enabled` - enable `/oauth/register`. Default `false`.
    * `:registration_default_scope` - the scope assigned to a dynamically
      registered client (RFC 7591 §2) when its request omits `scope`, echoed
      back in the §3.2.1 response. `:scopes_supported` assigns the full catalog;
      a list assigns that explicit subset (validated against `:scopes_supported`
      at boot). Default `nil` - a scopeless registration stays scopeless
      (fail-closed). Setting this lets a scopeless DCR client (e.g. an MCP/agent
      client) register with a usable scope without each host reinventing it.
    * `:client_id_metadata` - Client ID Metadata Document support - CIMD
      (`draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-01`, IETF OAuth WG). A
      keyword list configuring whether (and how) the authorization server
      dereferences an HTTPS `client_id` URL to a client metadata document. The
      whole feature is off by default; when `enabled: true`, discovery
      advertises `client_id_metadata_document_supported` and
      `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Resolver` resolves a CIMD `client_id`
      through the configured fetcher and cache. Read it back with
      `client_id_metadata/1` (the merged, defaulted keyword list) or the
      `client_id_metadata_enabled?/1` predicate. Recognized members, with their
      defaults:

        * `:enabled` - master switch. Default `false`.
        * `:fetcher` - module implementing
          `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Fetcher` (the SSRF-guarded outbound
          `GET`). Default `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Fetcher.Req`. A host
          may override with its own HTTP stack or a CIMD proxy service.
        * `:cache` - module implementing
          `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Cache`. Default
          `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Cache.Ecto` (cluster-coherent); a
          single-node deployment may select
          `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Cache.ETS`.
        * `:allow_loopback` - permit loopback addresses (the draft's "AS runs on
          loopback" exception; development only). Default `false`.
        * `:max_document_bytes` - body size cap for the fetched document
          (draft's recommended 5 KB). Default `5_120`.
        * `:request_timeout_ms` - connect and receive timeout for the fetch.
          Default `5_000`.
        * `:cache_ttl_bounds` - `{min_seconds, max_seconds}` the resolver clamps
          the response's `Cache-Control: max-age` / `Expires` freshness to
          (RFC 9111). Default `{60, 86_400}`.
        * `:require_same_origin_redirect_uri` - additionally require the request
          `redirect_uri` to be same-origin with the `client_id` URL, on top of
          the exact-match against the document's `redirect_uris` (draft §2 MAY,
          enforced by default here). Default `true`.
        * `:allowed_hosts` - optional allowlist of hostnames a CIMD `client_id`
          URL may resolve through; `nil` means "any public host" (subject to the
          fetcher's SSRF guard). Default `nil`.
        * `:blocked_hosts` - hostnames a CIMD `client_id` URL must never resolve
          through, checked before any network work. Default `[]`.
    * `:replay_check` - DPoP `jti` replay check (module or `{module, fun}`).
      Defaults to the single-node ETS replay cache.
    * `:nonce_store` - `Attesto.DPoP.NonceStore` implementation. Defaults to
      the single-node ETS nonce store.
    * `:presentation_session_store` - module implementing
      `Attesto.PresentationSessionStore` for verifier-side OID4VP request state.
      Required when the host mounts the `presentation: true` routes or calls
      `AttestoPhoenix.Verifier`.
    * `:verifier_client_id` - verifier identifier placed in the presentation
      request and used as the holder Key Binding JWT audience. Required when
      creating verifier presentation requests with the default or
      `"redirect_uri"` client-id scheme.
    * `:verifier_client_id_scheme` - OID4VP verifier client-id scheme. `nil`
      (the default) and `"redirect_uri"` retain the configured
      `:verifier_client_id`; `"x509_san_dns"` derives the identifier from
      `:verifier_dns`.
    * `:verifier_x5c` - verifier certificate chain as DER binaries, leaf first.
      Required when `:verifier_client_id_scheme` is `"x509_san_dns"`.
    * `:verifier_dns` - dNSName advertised by the verifier. Required when
      `:verifier_client_id_scheme` is `"x509_san_dns"`.
    * `:presentation_response_mode` - OID4VP response mode advertised to wallets.
      Defaults to `"direct_post"`; set to `"direct_post.jwt"` to require an
      encrypted authorization response. That mode also requires a usable
      `:verifier_encryption_keystore` when a presentation request is created.
    * `:sweep_interval_ms` - interval for `AttestoPhoenix.Store.Sweeper`. The
      sweeper is not started if unset.
    * `:table_prefix` - optional Ecto schema/table prefix for the generated
      tables.

  ### Endpoint paths advertised in metadata

  The discovery documents (RFC 8414 §3, OpenID Connect Discovery §4) and the
  RFC 7591 §3.2.1 registration response advertise absolute endpoint URLs built
  from the `:issuer` and the request path each endpoint is mounted at. By
  default the OAuth endpoints live under `/oauth/*` (the historic surface), but
  a host that mounts them elsewhere (for example under `/mcp/oauth/*` to avoid
  colliding with a legacy provider) MUST advertise the paths it actually serves
  or clients are misdirected. These keys control that, all additive with
  defaults that reproduce the historic `/oauth/*` surface exactly:

    * `:oauth_path_prefix` - path segment prepended to every OAuth endpoint
      tail. Default `"/oauth"`, yielding the historic `/oauth/token`,
      `/oauth/par`, etc. A host mounting under `/mcp/oauth` sets
      `oauth_path_prefix: "/mcp/oauth"` to advertise `/mcp/oauth/token` and so
      on. This is the FULL client-visible mount prefix, since the controllers
      cannot see the surrounding Phoenix `scope`. It does not relocate the
      router macro's discovery or JWKS routes. Those discovery routes are the
      fixed origin-issuer forms; see `AttestoPhoenix.Router` for the
      path-bearing issuer boundary.
    * `:authorize_path`, `:token_path`, `:par_path`, `:revocation_path`,
      `:introspection_path`, `:registration_path`, `:userinfo_path` - explicit per-endpoint path
      overrides. When set, the override wins over `:oauth_path_prefix` for that
      one endpoint (the integrator's "explicit endpoint overrides plus sane
      defaults"). Each defaults to `nil`, meaning "derive from
      `:oauth_path_prefix`". An override is an absolute path reference
      (`"/custom/token"`), advertised verbatim merged onto the issuer.

  Use the resolver helpers (`token_endpoint_url/1`, `par_endpoint_url/1`,
  `revocation_endpoint_url/1`, `registration_endpoint_url/1`,
  `userinfo_endpoint_url/1`, `authorize_endpoint_url/1`, `jwks_uri/1`, and the
  resolved-path helpers `token_path/1` and friends) rather than re-deriving the
  URLs in callers; the router macro derives its mounted-route tails from the
  same source so the mounted routes and the advertised routes cannot drift.

  ## Recommended production callback contracts

  The loose `*_client`, `*_principal`, `authorize_scope`, consent, registration,
  and event callbacks above are grouped into named behaviours that document the
  full contract (with the governing RFC for each callback) and serve as the
  recommended production shape: `AttestoPhoenix.ClientStore`,
  `AttestoPhoenix.PrincipalStore`, `AttestoPhoenix.ScopePolicy`,
  `AttestoPhoenix.ConsentPolicy`, `AttestoPhoenix.RegistrationStore`, and
  `AttestoPhoenix.EventSink`. Wiring stays identical: pass an anonymous
  function, a `{module, function}` pair, or a `{module, function, extra_args}`
  triple per key as documented above. The behaviours are the contract; the
  Config keys are how a host installs an implementation.

  ## Behaviour-module Config keys

  Rather than wiring every host callback as an individual flat key, a host may
  install one behaviour module per concern and let the library resolve each
  callback from it:

    * `:client_store` - a module implementing `AttestoPhoenix.ClientStore`.
    * `:principal_store` - a module implementing `AttestoPhoenix.PrincipalStore`.
    * `:consent_policy` - a module implementing `AttestoPhoenix.ConsentPolicy`.
    * `:scope_policy` - a module implementing `AttestoPhoenix.ScopePolicy`.
    * `:event_sink` - a module implementing `AttestoPhoenix.EventSink`.
    * `:registration` - a module implementing `AttestoPhoenix.RegistrationStore`.
    * `:claims_provider` - a module implementing `AttestoPhoenix.ClaimsProvider`.

  Each per-callback value is resolved through the matching resolver fun on this
  module (`client_id_fun/1`, `load_principal_fun/1`, `consent_fun/1`, and so on)
  with a single precedence: the explicit flat key wins when set; otherwise, when
  a behaviour module is installed and exports the corresponding behaviour
  callback (after `Code.ensure_loaded/1`), the `{module, function}` pair is used;
  otherwise the resolution is `nil` (and the consumer's existing fail-closed
  default applies). Flat keys therefore never break: a host that wires the
  individual callbacks keeps the exact behaviour it had. `new/1` validates at
  boot that any installed behaviour module is loadable and exports the callbacks
  it claims, so a typo'd or partial module fails fast rather than silently
  resolving to `nil` at request time.

  # `:loopback_redirect` is an OPT-OUT, defaulting to `true`. The §7.3 loopback

  # MUST: an authorization server that refused a native client's ephemeral port
  # would be non-conformant for a client the host had already declared to be an
  # installed app. Setting it `false` forbids the exception server-wide - an
  # operator kill switch, or a deployment certifying against a profile that
  # mandates exact redirect-URI matching.
  #
  # Nothing here is what keeps the profile off by default: `:client_native?`
  # defaults to `false`, so a deployment that classifies no clients has no
  # native clients and sees the unmodified RFC 6749 rules everywhere.
  #
  # `:reject_embedded_user_agents` IS a genuine opt-in flag, defaulting to
  # `false`. Unlike the rest of the profile it is a server-wide posture rather
  # than a per-client property: it is a `User-Agent` heuristic with real false
  # positives, and it deliberately is NOT scoped to native clients, because the
  # embedding application need not be the OAuth client.
  #
  # The §8.1 PKCE and §8.4 client-authentication rules take no flag at all: they
  # are restrictions that follow from `:client_native?` alone.
  #
  # `:loopback_include_localhost` is a genuine opt-in too, defaulting to
  # `false`: §7.3's MUST is scoped to the IP literals, so extending the port

  trusted configuration that raises aborts the request - successful ones
  included - instead of disguising a host failure as an authentication

  # for the `{module, function}` form to win. The precedence is fixed: an
  # explicit flat key wins; else the installed behaviour module if it exports
  # the callback; else `nil`. The arity is the behaviour callback's arity, used
  # only for the `function_exported?` conformance check - the resolved value is
  # the bare `{module, function}` pair, invoked by the caller through
  # `AttestoPhoenix.Callback.invoke/2,3` (which appends the per-call args).
  #
  # `:registration` carries the optional management callbacks too, so a host
  # that installs a single registration module gets RFC 7592 management for
  # free; the required `register_client/1` stays a flat-only required key.

  # document still serializes and is served 200, but a conformant client reading
  # it (RFC 8414 §2 for the OAuth metadata, OpenID Connect Discovery §3 for the
  # OpenID configuration) is misdirected to a missing or wrong endpoint and the
  # flow breaks with no error on the server. The motivating regression: the
  # RFC 8414 document once omitted `authorization_endpoint` (RFC 8414 §2 REQUIRES
  # it for the authorization-code flow) because the controller never supplied it,
  # so an OAuth client that reads RFC 8414 rather than OpenID Discovery (the
  # ChatGPT MCP connector) got a document missing a required endpoint. The two
  # checks below promote that class of failure from "ships a broken document" to
  # "fails fast at boot", matching how the required-key validation above already
  # fails `new/1` with an `ArgumentError`.

  # The discovery endpoints this library is responsible for deriving and that a
  # conformant authorization-code / OpenID Provider discovery document MUST carry
  # (RFC 8414 §2: `issuer`, `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`,
  # `jwks_uri`; OpenID Connect Discovery §3 requires the same set). Each entry is
  # `{member_name, resolver}` where the resolver derives the advertised value
  # from this config; the library owns every one of them (they are derived from
  # `:issuer` and the resolved endpoint paths), so every one MUST resolve to a
  # non-nil absolute HTTPS URL or the document would silently omit or
  # mis-advertise a required member.

  # The router macro (`AttestoPhoenix.Router.attesto_routes/1`) mounts EVERY
  # OAuth endpoint at a single shared prefix - a compile-time `"/oauth" <> tail`
  # joined under the macro's own `:prefix` option - so the mounted routes always
  # share one common mount tree and each ends in its canonical tail. The router's
  # macro `:prefix` is invisible at config-build time, so a full
  # advertised-vs-mounted cross-check is impossible here (the override could be
  # exactly where the host mounted the route by hand). What IS provable is the
  # discovery document's INTERNAL consistency: the host having committed to a
  # non-default `:oauth_path_prefix` (a deliberate "all my OAuth endpoints live
  # under this prefix" statement) AND then advertising one endpoint OUTSIDE that
  # prefix via an explicit per-endpoint override.
  #
  # We deliberately scope the check to a NON-DEFAULT `:oauth_path_prefix`. A
  # per-endpoint override is a documented, legitimate feature (the integrator's
  # "explicit endpoint overrides plus sane defaults"); flagging every override
  # would break that contract and contradict "do not invent constraints". But
  # once a host sets a custom prefix, an override that does not sit under it is
  # a precise silent mismatch: discovery advertises that endpoint under a
  # different prefix than its siblings (and than the prefix
  # the host declared), while the router mounts them all together, so a client is
  # misdirected to a route that is not served. That divergence is provable from
  # the config alone, so we raise.
