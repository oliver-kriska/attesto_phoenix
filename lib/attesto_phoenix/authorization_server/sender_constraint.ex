defmodule AttestoPhoenix.AuthorizationServer.SenderConstraint do
  @moduledoc """
  Sender-constraint resolution for the token endpoint (RFC 9449 / RFC 8705),
  as conn-free core.

  This is the single place that turns the sender-constraint facts of a token
  request - a presented DPoP proof (RFC 9449), a presented client certificate
  (RFC 8705), and the canonical request URL/method the proof is bound to
  (RFC 9449 §4.2 / §4.3) - together with the configured policy and the client's
  binding requirements into either a resolved binding or an
  `AttestoPhoenix.OAuthError`. The controller parses these facts off the
  `Plug.Conn` (via `AttestoPhoenix.RequestContext` and the `DPoP` request
  header) and passes them as a plain map; this module reads only data, never
  touches a conn, and never emits an event.

  ## Input

  `resolve/3` takes the validated `%AttestoPhoenix.Config{}`, the resolved
  client, and an `input` map the controller builds from the request:

    * `:dpop_proof` - the first `DPoP` request-header value (RFC 9449 §4.1), or
      `nil` when the request carries no proof.
    * `:mtls_cert_der` - the peer certificate DER (RFC 8705 §3), or `nil` when
      no client certificate was presented.
    * `:http_uri` - the canonical request URL (`htu`) the proof is bound to
      (RFC 9449 §4.3).
    * `:http_method` - the HTTP method (`htm`) the proof is bound to
      (RFC 9449 §4.2); the token endpoint is reached by POST.

  ## Return value

  `{:ok, binding, token_type}` where `binding` is one of `{:dpop, jkt}`,
  `{:mtls, thumbprint}`, or `:none`, and `token_type` is the RFC 9449 §7.1 /
  RFC 6750 presentation type (`"DPoP"` for a DPoP binding, `"Bearer"`
  otherwise). On failure, `{:error, %AttestoPhoenix.OAuthError{}}`.

  ## Precedence and fail-closed policy

  The client's *required* sender constraint is resolved first, and only the
  matching constraint type can satisfy it:

    * A client that requires DPoP (RFC 9449) is bound only by a DPoP proof. A
      request that omits the proof - even one presenting a client certificate -
      is refused (`DPoP proof required`), never silently mTLS-bound.
    * A client that requires mTLS (RFC 8705 §3) is bound only by a client
      certificate. A request that omits the certificate - even one presenting a
      DPoP proof - is refused (`client certificate required`), never silently
      DPoP-bound.

  A client's required constraint therefore cannot be satisfied by presenting a
  *different* valid constraint: the per-client policy is enforced on its own
  terms before any opportunistic binding is considered.

  Only when the client requires neither constraint does opportunistic
  precedence apply: DPoP takes precedence when a proof is presented
  (RFC 9449 §5); otherwise an mTLS certificate binds the token to its
  thumbprint; otherwise the token is an unbound Bearer.

  RFC 8705 §3: a client configured to require certificate-bound tokens MUST NOT
  be silently downgraded to a Bearer token when it calls without a certificate.
  RFC 9449 is the DPoP equivalent: a client configured for DPoP-bound issuance
  must present a proof at the token endpoint. The host's
  `:client_requires_mtls?` / `:client_requires_dpop?` callbacks gate this; both
  are read defensively and fail open only to "not required" when the host has
  not supplied the callback (the constraints are off by default per
  `:dpop_enabled` / `:mtls_enabled`).

  ## DPoP nonce challenge preserved

  When a fresh DPoP nonce is required (RFC 9449 §8 / §9), the returned
  `%AttestoPhoenix.OAuthError{}` carries the `use_dpop_nonce` code and the fresh
  `DPoP-Nonce` value in its `:headers`, so the controller renders the header
  verbatim alongside the error.

  Resolve the sender-constraint binding for a token request.

  Returns `{:ok, binding, token_type, pending_claim}` or
  `{:error, %OAuthError{}}`. See the module docs for the precedence rules and
  the input shape.

  `pending_claim` is the DPoP proof's replay claim, DEFERRED. The proof is
  verified here, but its `jti` is deliberately NOT yet recorded: `:replay_check`
  is a check-and-record operation, and running it at this point would let a
  caller who has proved nothing write to the replay store. A public client
  (RFC 6749 §2.1) authenticates with a `client_id` and no credential, so at this
  point in a token request the caller may be anyone who knows a registered
  public client's identifier - they could pair a self-signed proof with a bogus
  authorization code and grow the store a row per request.

  The caller MUST therefore pass this value to `commit_replay_claim/2` once the
  grant itself has been validated, and before a response is issued. RFC 9449
  §11.1 is unchanged by the deferral: the claim is still an atomic
  check-and-record, and it still happens before anything is minted.
