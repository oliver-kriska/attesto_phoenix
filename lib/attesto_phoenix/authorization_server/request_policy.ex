  whether `nonce` is required (OIDC Core §3.1.2.1) - are resolved here once,
  from `%AttestoPhoenix.Config{}` and the opaque host client, rather than
  duplicated per endpoint. This module reads only data: it touches no `conn` and

  For a CIMD client (`%CIMDClient{metadata: metadata}`,

  registration, so the registered set is the document's own `redirect_uris`
  (RFC 9700) and the host's per-client callback is never consulted. For a
  registered client the set is resolved through the host's
  `:client_redirect_uris` callback; an absent callback or a non-list return

  URI (fail closed).

  How the request `redirect_uri` is matched against the registered set
  (RFC 6749 §3.1.2.3, RFC 8252 §7.3).

  `:exact` - the RFC 6749 §3.1.2.3 simple string comparison - unless the host
  marked this client native via `:client_native?`, in which case it gets
  `:exact_allow_loopback_port` and its `http://127.0.0.1/...` /
  `http://[::1]/...` redirect URI matches on any port (see `Attesto.RedirectURI`
  for exactly how narrow that exception is). With
  `native_apps: [loopback_include_localhost: true]` the loopback mode is
  `:exact_allow_loopback_port_including_localhost` instead, extending the same
  port allowance to the bare `localhost` name
  (`Config.native_app_loopback_matching/1`).

  Marking the client native is the whole decision. RFC 8252 §7.3 says the
  authorization server MUST allow any port for a loopback redirect URI, so
  requiring a second server-wide opt-in on top would mean violating that MUST
  for a client the host had already declared to be an installed app.

  That is the entire argument, deliberately. A tempting second one - that §8.1
  and §8.4 already key on the mark alone, so §7.3 may too - does not hold up:
  those are RESTRICTIONS and this is a RELAXATION, and the two have very
  different blast radii when the mark is wrong. A mistaken restriction denies a
  client service loudly; a mistaken relaxation widens a security check
  silently. Which is why `:client_native?` is documented as an opt-in that a
  host must not export by accident.

  The default-off guarantee comes from `:client_native?` itself defaulting to
  `false`, not from a separate flag: a deployment that classifies no clients has
  no native clients and so sees exact matching everywhere, unchanged.

  `native_apps: [loopback_redirect: false]` remains available as a server-wide
  opt-out for a deployment that must forbid the exception outright (an operator
  kill switch, or one certifying against a profile that mandates exact
  matching). It defaults to `true`; it is an escape hatch, not a gate.

  A CIMD client has no `:client_native?` callback to consult - there is no host
  registry entry for it - so the decision comes from the document itself: a
  document that registered a loopback redirect URI is an installed app saying
  so in the only vocabulary CIMD gives it, and gets the same §7.3 allowance.

  It is deliberately NOT keyed on an `application_type` member. CIMD defines no
  such member (it inherits the DCR registry by reference, and whether that
  carries OIDC's `application_type` is an open question on the draft's own
  tracker), real documents do not carry it, and `Attesto.ClientIdMetadata`'s
  passthrough allowlist would drop it anyway. The declared `redirect_uris` are
  validated document content; a claimed type would not be.

  Whether PKCE is required for this client (RFC 7636 §4.3 / RFC 9700 §2.1.1,
  RFC 8252 §8.1).

  A public client MUST use PKCE, so `client_public?/2` forces it regardless of
  config. A sender-constrained client (DPoP or mTLS) is a FAPI 2.0 client, and
  FAPI 2.0 Security Profile §5.3.1.2 / RFC 9700 §2.1.1 require PKCE for it even
  though it authenticates confidentially - so `client_requires_dpop?/2` and
  `client_requires_mtls?/2` force it too. RFC 8252 §8.1 requires it for a native
  app, so `client_native?/2` forces it as well; the requirement is stated for
  public native clients, and applying it to any native client is strictly
  safer - a native app that claims to be confidential cannot actually hold a
  secret (§8.4). For any other confidential client the global `:require_pkce`
  flag applies (default `true`). Fail closed: absent the host's deliberate
  opt-out, PKCE is required.

  RFC 8252 §8.1 also requires `S256` rather than `plain`. That needs no policy
  here: `Attesto.AuthorizationRequest` rejects `code_challenge_method=plain`
  and any non-`S256` method unconditionally, for every client.
