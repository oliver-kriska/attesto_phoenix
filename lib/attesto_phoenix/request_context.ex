defmodule AttestoPhoenix.RequestContext do
  @moduledoc """
  Neutral request-fact helpers the OAuth 2.0 / OIDC flows derive from a `Plug.Conn`.

  Authorization-server endpoints need a handful of transport-level facts that are
  not safe to read straight off the `Plug.Conn` when the listener sits behind a
  reverse proxy:

    * the **client IP**, honoring `X-Forwarded-For` only for trusted proxies;
    * whether the request effectively arrived over **HTTPS** (RFC 8446), honoring
      a trusted `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` hop;
    * the canonical request **URL** (`htu`) and **method** (`htm`) a DPoP proof is
      bound to, per RFC 9449 §4.2 / §4.3;
    * the peer **certificate DER** presented at the TLS layer, used for the
      RFC 8705 §3 mutual-TLS `cnf` binding;
    * whether the request appears to come from an **embedded user agent**
      (an in-app webview), which RFC 8252 §8.12 recommends refusing at the
      authorization endpoint.

  Every forwarded-header-derived fact is gated on a trusted-proxy allowlist. A
  request that arrives from a peer outside that allowlist with forged
  `X-Forwarded-*` headers is a spoofing attempt: the headers are dropped and the
  fact is derived from the direct connection only. This is fail-closed by
  construction, an untrusted peer cannot assert `https`, cannot redirect the
  DPoP `htu`, and cannot forge a client IP.

  The trust boundary, the HTTPS requirement, and the optional certificate
  extractor are read from `AttestoPhoenix.Config`; this module never hardcodes
  deployment policy.

  ## Trusted-proxy allowlist

  `config.trusted_proxies` controls whether `X-Forwarded-*` headers are honored.
  It accepts a list whose elements are any of:

    * `:loopback` - matches `127.0.0.0/8` and `::1`.
    * `:any` - matches every peer. Only safe when another mechanism (firewall,
      ingress ACL) guarantees that only the proxy can reach the app port. Prefer
      explicit CIDRs.
    * an IP tuple (`{10, 0, 0, 1}` / an 8-element IPv6 tuple) - exact match.
    * a binary CIDR string (`"10.0.0.0/8"`, `"::1/128"`) - subnet match.

  The default (`[]`) trusts no proxy, so forwarded headers are never honored
  unless the host opts in.

  Returns `true` when the request's `User-Agent` looks like an embedded user
  agent - an in-app webview - rather than the system browser (RFC 8252 §8.12).

  §8.12 recommends that an authorization server not permit an embedded user
  agent for the authorization request: the application hosting the webview can
  read the page's DOM, inject scripts, and capture keystrokes, so the user's
  credentials are exposed to the very party the authorization is meant to
  constrain. The native-app remedy is an external user agent - the system
  browser, an in-app browser tab (`SFSafariViewController` /
  Android Custom Tabs) - which the host application cannot inspect.

  ## This is a heuristic

  The `User-Agent` is client-supplied and unauthenticated. A webview can send
  any string, so this check is trivially evaded by an attacker who wants to; and
  because it matches on product tokens and platform quirks it will
  misclassify some honest browsers. It is therefore a defense-in-depth hint,
  never a security boundary, and the enforcement it backs is off by default (see
  `check_embedded_user_agent/2`).

  Both error directions are real and known:

    * **False negatives.** Any Android webview whose host app calls
      `setUserAgentString/1` and drops the `wv` token is missed, as is any
      in-app browser whose product token is not on the list. The list names the
      largest ones; it cannot be complete.
    * **False positives.** An iOS web app launched from the home screen
      (standalone display mode) is indistinguishable from a WKWebView by
      `User-Agent` and is flagged. Deployments serving such an app should leave
      this off.

  Only the `User-Agent` is consulted. `X-Requested-With` is deliberately
  ignored: Android webviews set it to the host application's package name, but
  so have some Custom Tabs implementations, and Custom Tabs is precisely the
  RFC 8252 §8.1-recommended arrangement - keying on that header would refuse the
  behavior the RFC asks for.

  A request with no `User-Agent` is not treated as embedded: absence is not
  evidence, and refusing it would break non-browser callers.

  caller reports the failure directly to the user agent - there is no trusted
