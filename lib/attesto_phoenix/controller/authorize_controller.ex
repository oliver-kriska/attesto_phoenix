defmodule AttestoPhoenix.Controller.AuthorizeController do
  @moduledoc """
  OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect authorization endpoint (RFC 6749 §3.1,
  OIDC Core §3.1.2).

  Handles `GET /oauth/authorize`, the front-channel browser flow that ends in
  an authorization code (RFC 6749 §4.1). This module owns only the HTTP and
  protocol-framing concerns: it parses and validates the request through
  `Attesto.AuthorizationRequest`, classifies failures by where they may be
  reported (OIDC Core §3.1.2.6), and on success mints a single-use code through
  `Attesto.AuthorizationCode.issue/3` and redirects back to the client. Every
  identity decision - who the resource owner is, and whether they consent - is
  delegated to host callbacks on `AttestoPhoenix.Config`. No login or consent
  UI lives here.

  ## Error disposition (OIDC Core §3.1.2.6, RFC 6749 §4.1.2.1)

  The `client_id` and `redirect_uri` are validated BEFORE anything is rendered
  or redirected. A request whose `client_id` is unknown, or whose
  `redirect_uri` does not exactly match the client's registered set, is
  untrusted: the server MUST NOT redirect back to the supplied URI (that would
  be an open redirect), so it renders a direct error page to the user agent.
  Only once the `client_id`/`redirect_uri` pair is established as trusted is any
  further error (bad `response_type`, `scope`, PKCE, `max_age`) reported by
  redirecting back to the validated `redirect_uri` with an `error` (and
  `error_description`/`state`) query parameter. `Attesto.AuthorizationRequest`
  performs this classification; this controller turns each class into the
  correct HTTP response.

  ## PKCE is mandatory (RFC 7636)

  `Attesto.AuthorizationRequest` requires a valid S256 `code_challenge`; there
  is no PKCE-less path. The challenge is carried into the issued code so the
  token endpoint can verify the matching verifier on redemption.

  ## Resource-owner authentication and consent (host policy)

  Authenticating the end user and obtaining consent are host policy, not
  protocol, so they are delegated to two `AttestoPhoenix.Config` callbacks:

    * `:authenticate_resource_owner` - `(conn, request, auth_opts ->
      {:authenticated, subject} | {:halt, conn} | {:none} | {:error,
      :login_required | :consent_required | :interaction_required})`. Returns
      `{:authenticated, subject}` once a resource owner is established for this
      request, `{:halt, conn}` to take over the connection (e.g. redirect to a
      login page that, after login, re-enters this endpoint with the same
      authorization parameters), `{:none}` when no subject can be established
      without UI, or an `{:error, _}` to explicitly classify why interaction is
      required (OIDC Core §3.1.2.6). The `subject` is a map carrying at least
      `:subject` (the subject identifier, OIDC Core §2 `sub`) and optionally
      `:auth_time`, `:acr`, and `:amr` (OIDC Core §2), plus `:sid` (the host's
      session id, OIDC Back-Channel Logout 1.0 §2.1 — supply it to make the
      session reachable by the end-session endpoint), threaded into the code's
      claims so the token endpoint can mint the ID token.

      `auth_opts` is a map carrying the OIDC Core §3.1.2.1 authentication
      directives the host MUST honour: `:prompt` (the parsed `prompt` list),
      `:force_reauth` (`true` for `prompt=login`: reauthenticate even if a
      session exists, returning a fresh `auth_time`), `:interactive` (`false`
      for `prompt=none`: the host MUST NOT render any UI, returning
      `{:authenticated, subject}` only if it can be established silently, else
      `{:none}`), and `:max_age` (when present, the host MUST reauthenticate if
      the existing authentication is older and return the resulting
      `auth_time`). Under `prompt=none` the controller converts a `{:halt,
      conn}` or `{:none}` into a `login_required` redirect rather than letting
      any UI run; a `{:halt, conn}` consent screen becomes `consent_required`
      (OIDC Core §3.1.2.6).

    * `:consent` - `(conn, request, subject -> {:consented, subject} |
      {:halt, conn} | {:denied, reason})`. Returns `{:consented, subject}` once
      the resource owner has authorized the request (the returned `subject` may
      carry consent-derived claims), `{:halt, conn}` to take over the
      connection (e.g. render a consent screen that re-enters this endpoint), or
      `{:denied, _reason}` to refuse, which is reported back to the client as
      the RFC 6749 §4.1.2.1 `access_denied` error by redirect. When the host
      does not supply `:consent`, consent is treated as implicitly granted for
      the authenticated subject.

  Both callbacks may hand control back to a host-rendered page; the controller
  only proceeds to mint a code when both yield a subject. The actual login and
  consent UI lives in the host application, never in this library.

  ## Configuration contract

  All host policy is resolved through `AttestoPhoenix.Config`; nothing is
  hardcoded here. This controller reads (see `AttestoPhoenix.Config` for the
  authoritative definitions and defaults):

    * `:load_client` - client lookup and revocation gate (RFC 6749 §2.2). An
      unknown or revoked client is a direct (non-redirectable) error.
    * `:client_redirect_uris` - `(client -> [String.t()])` the client's
      registered redirect URIs, the trusted set the request `redirect_uri` is
      exact-matched against (RFC 6749 §3.1.2.3).
    * `:client_id` - `(client -> String.t())` the client's identifier, carried
      into the issued code.
    * `:authenticate_resource_owner`, `:consent` - the host login/consent hooks
      described above.
    * `:code_store` - the `Attesto.CodeStore` backing the issued code.
    * `:authorization_code_ttl` - the code lifetime, seconds.
    * `:on_event` - the optional audit/telemetry hook (via
      `AttestoPhoenix.Event`).

  # The registered redirect-URI set is a fact the host supplies via

  # supply the callback exposes no registered URIs, so every request is rejected
  # with `{:direct, :redirect_uri_not_registered}` (fail closed) rather than
  # silently trusting the supplied URI. Matching is exact unless the host marked
  # this client native, in which case RFC 8252 §7.3 lets its loopback redirect
  # URI vary in port; `RequestPolicy.redirect_uri_matching/2` owns that
  # decision. An unmatched URI stays non-redirectable under every policy.
  #
  # OIDC Core §3.1.2.1: the `nonce` is OPTIONAL for the code flow by default, but
  # an OpenID Provider MAY require it. When the host sets `:require_nonce`, a
  # request whose scope contains `openid` (an OpenID Connect Authentication
  # Request) must carry a `nonce`; the core rejects a missing one with a
  # redirectable `invalid_request`. A plain OAuth 2.0 request (no `openid` scope)
  # is never subject to the requirement (RFC 6749 keeps the code at SHOULD), so
  # the flag is scoped to OIDC requests via `openid_request?/1`.

  # `redirect_uri` is not a trusted URI for this client, so its failure is
  # non-redirectable - a direct error, like an unregistered redirect_uri. Only
  # applies to CIMD clients; a registered client has no `client_id` URL to be
