defmodule AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Cache.Ecto do
  @moduledoc """
  Postgres-backed `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Cache` for clustered
  deployments - CIMD (`draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-01`, IETF
  OAuth WG).

  CIMD lets a client identify itself with no prior registration by using an
  HTTPS URL as its `client_id`; the authorization server dereferences that URL
  and validates the returned document. Caching the validated document keeps
  every authorization request from reaching out to the network. The per-node
  `AttestoPhoenix.ClientIdMetadata.Cache.ETS` opt-out would re-fetch on each
  node and offers no coherence; this store persists each entry so a document
  fetched on one node is served from every node and the outbound fetch fan-out
  is bounded under load. It is the cache default for exactly the same reason the
  code/refresh/nonce/replay/PAR stores default to Ecto.

  Only a *validated* document is ever written (the caller stores after
  `Attesto.ClientIdMetadata.validate_document/2` succeeds, with an `expires_at`
  derived from the response's freshness directives clamped to the configured
  bounds); the draft (§6) and RFC 9111 forbid caching errors or malformed
  documents, so this store never validates and never sees an unaccepted
  document.

  ## Behaviour callbacks

    * `get/1` resolves a live (unexpired) cached document WITHOUT consuming it.
      Expiry is re-checked on read (`expires_at > now`), so an unswept expired
      row is a `:miss`, never a stale hit.
    * `put/3` upserts the validated metadata and its expiry. A re-fetched
      document legitimately supersedes a stale one, so a conflicting `url`
      replaces the existing row's `metadata` and `expires_at` rather than
      failing - the freshest fetch wins.

  Expired rows are reclaimed by `AttestoPhoenix.Store.Sweeper`, but sweeping is
  housekeeping only: `get/1` already refuses an expired row.

  The repository module is supplied by the host application (`:repo` under the
  `:attesto_phoenix` app) and read at call time; a cache with no backing
  repository fails closed rather than silently no-opping.

  Resolves a live cached document for a CIMD `client_id` URL.

  Returns `{:ok, metadata}` when a row exists and has not expired, or `:miss`
  when it is absent or expired. `metadata` is round-tripped through `jsonb`, so
  the caller reads back the same string-keyed map it stored. Freshness is
  enforced on read (`expires_at > now`); resolution does not consume the entry,
  so it serves every request until it expires or is replaced.

  on conflict the stored `metadata` and `expires_at` are replaced with the
  freshly fetched values (the freshest accepted document wins), rather than
  raising or keeping a stale entry.
