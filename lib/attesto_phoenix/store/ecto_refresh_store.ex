defmodule AttestoPhoenix.Store.EctoRefreshStore do
  @moduledoc """
  Ecto implementation of the `Attesto.RefreshStore` behaviour.

  The protocol core (`Attesto.RefreshToken`) owns all rotation logic and reuse
  detection; this module is purely the storage seam. It persists refresh-token
  records over `AttestoPhoenix.Schema.RefreshToken` and provides the atomic
  single-use claim on which reuse detection depends (RFC 6749 §10.4, OAuth 2.0
  Security BCP §4.13).

  ## Why the claim must be atomic

  Rotation requires detecting when an already-rotated (consumed) token is
  presented again: that is the captured-token signal, and the whole family
  must then be revoked. Reliable detection needs a compare-and-set that, in
  one indivisible step, checks the token is unconsumed and marks it consumed.
  Here that is a single conditional `UPDATE ... RETURNING`:

      UPDATE attesto_refresh_tokens
         SET consumed = true, consumed_at = now()
       WHERE token_hash = $1 AND consumed = false
      RETURNING ...

  Zero rows updated *with a row still present* means the token was already
  consumed: reuse. A non-atomic read-then-write would let two concurrent
  rotations both observe "unconsumed" and both succeed, defeating detection.
  This holds across all nodes sharing the database, which the single-node ETS
  store cannot offer. `consume/1` returns `{:ok, entry}` to the single winner,
  `{:reuse, entry}` on a replay, and `:error` for an unknown token.

  ## Sticky revocation

  `revoke_family/1` marks every row in the family revoked (it does not delete
  them) so the revocation persists. A subsequent `insert/1` checks the family
  before writing and refuses with `{:error, :family_revoked}`, so a successor
  whose claim won before the revocation landed cannot be added to a revoked
  family. Revocation therefore rejects later inserts, not only the rows present
  when it ran. The check and the insert run in one transaction so no concurrent
  revocation can interleave between them.

  The repo is resolved from the application environment (`:repo` under the
  `:attesto_phoenix` app) so the host owns the connection; nothing here
  hardcodes an OTP app's repo, and a missing repo fails closed.

  Returns `{:error, :family_revoked}` when the record's `:family_id` has
  already been revoked, and the row is NOT written. The revocation check and
  the insert run in one transaction holding a per-family advisory lock (shared
  with `revoke_family/1`), so a concurrent revocation cannot interleave and
  leave a live successor in a revoked family (sticky revocation, RFC 6749
  §10.4). A plain `FOR UPDATE` on the existing rows would not suffice: under
  `READ COMMITTED` a revoking `UPDATE` that began before this insert committed
  would not see the just-inserted successor (a phantom), leaving it live. The
  advisory lock serializes the two operations outright, so a revocation that
  loses the race still runs its `UPDATE` on a fresh snapshot that includes the
  new row. The opaque store record is flattened onto the schema columns by
  `AttestoPhoenix.Schema.RefreshToken.from_store_record/2`.
