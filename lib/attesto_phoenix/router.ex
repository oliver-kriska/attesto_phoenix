defmodule AttestoPhoenix.Router do
  @moduledoc """
  Router macro that mounts the authorization-server endpoints.

  `use AttestoPhoenix.Router` makes the `attesto_routes/1` macro available
  inside a `Phoenix.Router`. Calling it inside (or alongside) a `scope`
  declares the OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect server surface. The two discovery
  routes listed below are the registered forms for an origin-only issuer. A
  path-bearing issuer has different standards-derived well-known locations;
  the host must mount those explicitly rather than use these convenience
  routes unchanged.

    * `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` - authorization-server
      metadata (RFC 8414 §3).
    * `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration` - OpenID Provider configuration
      (OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 §4), omitted with
      `openid_configuration: false`.
    * `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` - the JSON Web Key Set of the verification
      keys (RFC 7517 §5; the discovery document's `jwks_uri` per RFC 8414 §2).
    * `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` - protected-resource metadata
      (RFC 9728 §3), the discovery target of the §5.1 `WWW-Authenticate`
      challenge the resource-server plugs emit. For a resource identifier that
      carries a path, the §3.1 **path-inserted** form
      (`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`) is mounted via
      `:protected_resource_paths` - see the option below; the root document
      alone does not satisfy clients that derive that form.
    * `GET /oauth/authorize` - the authorization endpoint (RFC 6749 §3.1;
      OpenID Connect Core 1.0 §3.1.2).
    * `POST /oauth/token` - the token endpoint (RFC 6749 §3.2).
    * `POST /oauth/par` - pushed authorization requests (RFC 9126).
    * `POST /oauth/revoke` - the token revocation endpoint (RFC 7009 §2).
    * `POST /oauth/introspect` - the token introspection endpoint (RFC 7662 §2),
      with the RFC 9701 signed-JWT response negotiated by the `Accept` header.
    * `POST /oauth/register` - dynamic client registration (RFC 7591 §3.1),
      mounted only when registration is enabled (see `:registration` below).
    * `DELETE /oauth/register/:client_id` - dynamic client registration
      management cleanup (RFC 7592 §2), mounted with registration.
    * `POST /oauth/nonce` - the OID4VCI c_nonce endpoint, mounted only with
      `credential_issuance: true`.
    * `GET /oauth/statuslist/:id` - the IETF Token Status List endpoint,
      mounted only with `status_list: true`.
    * `GET` and `POST /oauth/userinfo` - the UserInfo endpoint (OpenID Connect
      Core 1.0 §5.3); a bearer-authenticated protected resource (RFC 6750
      §2.1/§2.2), omitted with `userinfo: false`.
    * `POST /oauth/credential` - the OID4VCI Credential endpoint, mounted only
      with `credential_issuance: true`.
    * `GET /oauth/credential_offer/:id` - the OID4VCI by-reference Credential
      Offer endpoint (`credential_offer_uri` §4.1.3), mounted only with
      `credential_issuance: true`.
    * `POST /oauth/deferred_credential` - the OID4VCI Deferred Credential
      endpoint (§9), mounted only with `credential_issuance: true`.
    * `GET /oauth/presentation_request/:id` - the OID4VP signed request-object
      endpoint, mounted only with `presentation: true`.
    * `POST /oauth/presentation_response` - the OID4VP direct-post response
      endpoint, mounted only with `presentation: true`.
    * `GET /.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` - OID4VCI Credential Issuer
      Metadata, mounted with `credential_issuance: true`.
    * `GET /.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer` - SD-JWT VC JWT VC Issuer Metadata,
      mounted with `credential_issuance: true`.
    * `GET /.well-known/openid-federation` - the signed OpenID Federation
      Entity Configuration, mounted with `federation: true`.
    * `GET` and `POST /oauth/end_session` - the end-session endpoint (OpenID
      Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 §2), mounted only with `logout: true`.
    * `GET /oauth/check_session` - the `check_session_iframe` (OpenID Connect
      Session Management 1.0 §3.3), mounted only with `session_management: true`.

  The macro emits nothing but `Phoenix.Router` route entries pointing at this
  library's controllers; it holds no policy of its own. Every behavioral
  decision (which clients exist, which scopes are granted, whether DPoP / mTLS
  binding is offered, whether registration is open) is owned by the host
  through `AttestoPhoenix.Config`, which the controllers read at request time.

  ## Placement and pipelines

  The discovery, optional OpenID configuration, and JWKS documents are
  unauthenticated public metadata (RFC 8414 §5; OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0
  §4; RFC 8615).
  The authorization endpoint does not authenticate the client (RFC 6749 §3.1):
  the resource owner authenticates through the host's login/consent callbacks,
  so it carries no client-authentication pipeline. The token, revocation, and
  registration endpoints authenticate the client from the request itself
  (RFC 6749 §2.3, RFC 7009 §2, RFC 7591 §3), and the UserInfo endpoint is
  bearer-authenticated from its configured RFC 6750 credential channels by its
  controller, rather than from a caller session, so they too take no
  session-bearing pipeline. Supply a `:pipeline` to attach transport-level
  concerns the host wants in front of every endpoint (for example an
  HTTPS-enforcing plug), and use `:route_pipelines` when the interactive,
  metadata, and non-browser protocol surfaces need different host pipelines.

      scope "/" do
        attesto_routes()
      end

      # or with a host pipeline and a mount prefix:
      scope "/" do
        attesto_routes(pipeline: :oauth_server, prefix: "/auth")
      end

      # or classify browser-facing routes separately while retaining shared
      # transport policy on every class:
      scope "/" do
        attesto_routes(
          pipeline: :oauth_common,
          route_pipelines: [
            interactive: [:oauth_interactive, :oauth_common]
          ]
        )
      end

  A route-class override is the complete ordered pipeline list for that class;
  Attesto does not append or prepend the `:pipeline` default. The host remains
  responsible for the policy inside those pipelines. In particular, externally
  submitted OAuth POST requests must not accidentally inherit a generic browser
  pipeline that rejects them through CSRF protection or browser-only `Accept`
  negotiation. The `:interactive` name means that those endpoints participate
  in resource-owner/browser interactions; it does not mean Attesto silently
  applies the host's ordinary browser pipeline.

  ## Options

    * `:prefix` - path segment prepended to the `/oauth/*` endpoints. It does
      not apply to this macro's root well-known routes. Defaults to `""`. Those
      fixed routes are standards-correct for an origin-only issuer; a
      path-bearing issuer requires the host to mount the distinct OIDC
      Discovery and RFC 8414 derived locations explicitly.
    * `:pipeline` - a pipeline name (atom) or list of pipeline names to
      `pipe_through` for the mounted routes. Defaults to `[]` (no extra
      pipeline; the surrounding `scope`'s `pipe_through`, if any, still
      applies).
    * `:route_pipelines` - optional route-class overrides. Accepts a keyword
      list whose keys are `:metadata`, `:interactive`, or `:protocol`, and
      whose values are a pipeline atom or an ordered list of pipeline atoms.
      An override replaces `:pipeline` for its class; classes not present keep
      the `:pipeline` default. The classes are:

        * `:metadata` - authorization-server discovery, OpenID configuration,
          Credential Issuer Metadata, OpenID Federation Entity Configuration,
          JWKS, and protected-resource metadata routes owned by this macro.
        * `:interactive` - authorization, device verification, end-session,
          and check-session routes.
        * `:protocol` - token, PAR, revocation, introspection, registration
          management, UserInfo, device authorization, and CIBA backchannel
          authentication routes, plus the public OID4VCI and OID4VP wallet
          endpoints.

      Unknown or duplicate class keys and malformed values raise
      `ArgumentError` during router compilation. When this option is absent,
      the legacy single-`:pipeline` route expansion is used unchanged. Write
      pipeline names as literal atoms/lists inside a Phoenix `scope`; module
      attributes are not available when Phoenix expands the nested route
      macro and are rejected with an actionable error.
    * `:registration` - when `true`, mounts `POST /oauth/register`
      (RFC 7591) and `DELETE /oauth/register/:client_id` (RFC 7592). Defaults
      to `false`. The endpoints still fail closed at request time unless the
      host has wired the registration callbacks in `AttestoPhoenix.Config`;
      this option only controls whether the routes exist, so a deployment that
      never offers registration presents no registration surface at all.
    * `:userinfo` - a compile-time route-mount control. When `false`, omits
      `GET`/`POST /oauth/userinfo` while retaining the generic OAuth
      authorization-server routes. Defaults to `true` for compatibility.
      The retained local Provider Metadata route suppresses only
      `userinfo_endpoint: :derived` at the removed route-equivalent path. A
      configured URL remains authoritative, so a host can replace the bundled
      controller at the same path. Dynamic surrounding Phoenix scopes are
      supported. A dynamic macro `:prefix` is rejected for this option
      combination because that prefix does not apply to the root metadata
      request; move it to a surrounding scope instead.
    * `:openid_configuration` - when `false`, omits the OpenID Provider
      configuration document while retaining RFC 8414 authorization-server
      metadata. This is also a compile-time route-mount control and defaults to
      `true` for compatibility. An OAuth-only host that is not an OpenID
      Provider normally disables this and `:userinfo`. OIDC conformance for
      features such as CIBA, logout, and session management relies on Provider
      Metadata, so deployments using those features must keep it enabled unless
      equivalent metadata is served separately.
    * `:device` - when `true`, mounts the RFC 8628 device-authorization
      endpoint and verification page. Defaults to `false`.
    * `:credential_issuance` - when `true`, mounts the OID4VCI nonce,
      credential, by-reference credential-offer, deferred-credential, and
      Credential Issuer Metadata and JWT VC Issuer Metadata endpoints. Defaults
      to `false`. The host must also configure `:build_credential`, a
      `:pre_authorized_code_store`, and `:credential_configurations_supported`.
      The by-reference credential offer route additionally requires a
      `:credential_offer_store` (a request answers 404 while it is unconfigured
      or the id is unknown), and the deferred-credential route requires
      `:build_deferred_credential` (like `:build_credential`, an unconfigured
      callback is a hard `ArgumentError` rather than a silent empty response).
    * `:federation` - when `true`, mounts the signed OpenID Federation Entity
      Configuration at `/.well-known/openid-federation`. Defaults to `false`.
      Configure `:federation_authority_hints` and
      `:federation_entity_metadata` through `AttestoPhoenix.Config` to include
      those optional claims.
    * `:status_list` - when `true`, mounts `GET /oauth/statuslist/:id`, the
      IETF Token Status List endpoint. Defaults to `false`. Independent of
      `:credential_issuance`: a host may issue status-referencing credentials
      through another channel and only need this endpoint to publish the
      lists. The host must also configure `:status_list_store`; the endpoint
      answers 404 for a list it cannot resolve.
    * `:presentation` - when `true`, independently mounts the public OID4VP
      request-object and direct-post response endpoints. Defaults to `false`.
      The host must configure `:presentation_session_store` and
      `:verifier_client_id`.
    * `:ciba` - when `true`, mounts `POST /oauth/bc-authorize`, the OpenID
      Connect CIBA backchannel authentication endpoint. Defaults to `false`.
      The endpoint still fails closed at request time unless the host also
      enables `ciba: [enabled: true]` in `AttestoPhoenix.Config`.
    * `:logout` - when `true`, mounts `GET`/`POST /oauth/end_session` (OpenID
      Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0). Defaults to `false`.
    * `:session_management` - when `true`, mounts `GET /oauth/check_session`
      (OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 §3.3). Defaults to `false`. The
      page answers 404 unless the host also enables
      `session_management: [enabled: true]` in `AttestoPhoenix.Config`.
    * `:protected_resource_paths` - additionally mounts the RFC 9728 §3.1
      **path-inserted** protected-resource metadata URI for the given resource
      path. RFC 9728 §3.1 derives the well-known URI by inserting the
      well-known segment between the origin and the resource path: for the
      resource identifier `https://host.example/mcp` the metadata lives at
      `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`. The root document alone is
      NOT RFC 9728-complete for such a resource: clients that derive the
      path-inserted URI from the resource URL (current MCP clients probe it
      first, before the `WWW-Authenticate` `resource_metadata` fallback) miss
      a host that serves only the root form. Accepts a single-element list
      (`["/mcp"]`; a bare `"mcp"` is normalized to `"/mcp"`). The served
      document must satisfy RFC 9728 §3.3 - its `resource` member must equal
      the identifier the URI was derived from - so the controller fails closed
      at request time when the configured resource identifier's path does not
      match. More than one entry is a compile-time error: one controller
      document cannot equal two identifiers; multi-resource hosts should use
      `attesto_mcp`'s `AttestoMCP.Router.attesto_mcp_protected_resource_metadata/2`,
      which serves per-resource documents. Defaults to `[]` (root only,
      today's behavior).
    * `:protected_resource_root` - when `false`, does not mount the root
      `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` document. Use this when PRM
      ownership lives elsewhere: a host that mounts `attesto_mcp`'s
      `attesto_mcp_protected_resource_metadata/2` with its root compatibility
      document enabled should pass `protected_resource_root: false` here so
      exactly one package owns each PRM route. Defaults to `true` (today's
      behavior).

  The library never inspects `:registration` to make a policy decision: it is
  a route-existence toggle. Metadata is otherwise derived from
  `AttestoPhoenix.Config` at request time rather than from macro options. The
  bounded exception is `userinfo: false`: the retained local Provider Metadata
  route records the removed route so only `userinfo_endpoint: :derived` can be
  suppressed when it resolves there. A configured HTTPS URL is authoritative,
  including at the same path, which lets the host replace the bundled
  controller without losing discovery. For a dynamically discovered and
  dynamically registered OpenID Provider that issues access tokens, the OIDC
  requirements for Discovery and UserInfo still apply; the opt-outs are not a
  claim that every combination is an OIDC-conformant deployment.

  ## How protected-resource discovery actually happens

  A client calls the resource URL and gets a 401 whose `WWW-Authenticate`
  challenge carries a `resource_metadata` pointer (RFC 9728 §5.1). Modern
  clients ALSO - often first - derive the §3.1 path-inserted well-known URI
  from the resource URL itself (`https://host.example/mcp` →
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`) and probe it before falling
  back to the challenge pointer. Both URIs must serve the same document, and
  its `resource` member must equal the identifier the URI was derived from
  (§3.3) or the client is required to reject it. A single-resource AS+RS host
  covers all of this with `attesto_routes(protected_resource_paths: ["/mcp"])`;
  a host with multiple protected resources needs per-resource documents and
  should mount them with `attesto_mcp`'s
  `AttestoMCP.Router.attesto_mcp_protected_resource_metadata/2` instead
  (passing `protected_resource_root: false` here if that macro also owns the
  root document, so each PRM route has exactly one owner).
